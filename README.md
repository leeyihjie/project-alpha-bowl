***Personal Project.***

Aim of this project is to create a basic bowling scoring system which calculates your maximum available score based on current frame scores. 

Project Phase Uno: (Frontend) (Current)
- Users input current frame scores -> Current maximum available score for that game will be returned and displayed to them in accordance to the stipulated scoring rules.\


**Introduction to Bowling**
A single bowling game consists of 10 “frames”, with each frame of the first 9 frames consisting of two attempts to knock down ten pins and the last frame (10th frame) having its own special ruleset.

Each bowling pin that is knocked down constitutes a point. Knocking down all 10 pins in the first shot of a frame is called a "STRIKE". Knocking down all 10 pins within the first two shots of a frame is called a "SPARE". Getting a 'Strike' or a 'Spare' results in additional points added to your overall score (Detailed Scoring System explained in the section below)

Failing to knock down all 10 pins within the two shots of a frame is called an "OPEN FRAME".
